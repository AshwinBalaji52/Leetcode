given an integer array nums where the elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height-balanced binary search tree.

A height-balanced binary tree is a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differs by more than one.



class Solution:
    def sortedArrayToBST(self, nums: List[int]) -> TreeNode:
        
        if not nums: return None
        
		# Find the middle point which you can define as root
        length = len(nums)
        middle = length//2
        
        node = TreeNode(nums[middle])
        node.left = self.sortedArrayToBST(nums[:middle])
        node.right = self.sortedArrayToBST(nums[middle+1:])
        
        return node
